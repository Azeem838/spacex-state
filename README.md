## Project Description

Welcome to the SpaceX Stats page. This page was built with React and Redux. It uses the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) form which, details of each launch are fetched, organised and displayed to you.

This project takes all the launches from the API and sorts then by type of rocket. The launches of the different rockets can be navigated in the Navbar at the top of the page or by clicking any 1 of the rockets on the Home Page.
Each rocket's image and details are displayed in a card on the page. Any of these cards are clickable, which will take you to a details page. This details page consists of an embedded YouTube video (the official live stream) as well as some other links to various articles and Reddit posts. Lastely, a swipable image gallery is displayed at the bottom of the page.

At the moment, 3 of the 4 SpaceX rockets have flown. Fingers crossed for Starship :smile:
